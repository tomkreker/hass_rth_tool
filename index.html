		<h3>Welcome!</h3>
		This tool estimates an appropriate goal or benchmark for each shelter’s RTH rate for dogs.  The benchmark will vary, based on each shelter’s characteristics, which are accounted for by the inputs for the calculator.  These are based on an analysis of RTH rates for over 1,000 organizations.  The factors that have gone into the calculator are widely available in existing shelter data and were found to have a meaningful relationship with an organization’s RTH rate. 
		Unfortunately, cat RTH is often too low to produce similar estimates, but insights on cat RTH, and a more detailed description, are provided below.

		<br><b>What does this result mean?</b><br>
		The calculated benchmark or goal for your shelter’s RTH rate is a reflection of organizations with a similar profile to yours, based on the 1000+ organizations included in the data. It is an average for how similar organizations are performing with RTH rates.
		<br><b>If this is higher than your current RTH rate for dogs:</b> this can be a goal to aspire to!
		<br><br><b>If this is lower or close to your current RTH rate for dogs:</b> this means you are doing better than some similar organizations. Congrats! You may want to aspire even higher, and set a goal that is closer to higher-performing organizations as opposed to the average.<div id="output-Highperf"></div>

    <h3>How It All Works</h3>

	<div class="free-text">
		<details>
			<summary>How are we defining RTH Rate?</summary>
			<p>Since counting the number of RTH outcomes alone makes it difficult to compare performance across shelters of varying sizes, we normally define a shelter’s RTH “rate” as the percentage of stray intakes that have an RTH outcome. This ensures the rate is measuring RTH in the context of lost and found pets only, as opposed to cases like custody or seizures, in which the owner is known. However, we have seen in our engagement with shelters across the industry that RTH rates are not always measured this way. For this tool, we wanted to include the largest number of organizations possible in our dataset, for which data from Shelter Animal Counts (SAC) is most helpful. Unfortunately, from data reported to SAC, it is impossible to know which of the reported outcomes were stray intakes. As a proxy, SAC reports the percentage of RTH outcomes out of  total outcomes as an RTH rate. We found that while this rate varies from what we would consider the “true” RTH rate in individual shelters, it is fairly accurate on average, both over- and under-estimating the rate calculated using stray intakes only in different cases. As it enables us to access the breadth of SAC data, this is the RTH rate used in this tool.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>How did we arrive at the characteristics used in the calculator?</summary>
			<p>We wanted to provide shelters with a data-driven method to come up with a goal for RTH rate, to guide lost pet reunification efforts and understand where they stand relative to other organizations. We recognized that different kinds of organizations have different capacities for RTH. For example, we assumed that an organization taking in 200 stray animals annually will have an easier time returning 30% of them home than an organization taking in 2000 animals. There are also many factors other than intake volume that would presumably affect RTH rates. So the task at hand was to first identify factors that influence RTH rates (like intake size), and then be able to produce estimated RTH rates for organizations based on them. We used simple statistical modeling to achieve just that, and the results of this model have been used to select the factors used to generate estimated RTH rate benchmarks, and identify how each factor should affect the result. The factors we identified appear in the input section or are derived from them (for example, we ask for a US state, and the model assigns the region each state is classified into – see further explanation later). An organization can insert these few simple details and receive a “predicted” RTH rate, which can be interpreted as the RTH rate that is expected for organizations of their kind, given the RTH rates of all organizations in the data.</p>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>What are the features actually used in the calculation and how do they affect the result?</summary>
			<ul>
				<li>Organization type - using SAC’s classification. Government shelters > Nonprofits with contract > Non profits without contract. Rescues were not included as they do not typically take in stray/loose pets and partake in significant reunification efforts.</li>
				<li>Region - a standard division based on the chosen US state into Northeast, Midwest (with RTH rates equivalent to each other), West (higher rates), and South (lower rates).</li>
				<li>Annual stray intakes – referring to stray intake only, and grouped into four categories: up to 500, 500-1500, 1500-3000, and 3000+. The higher the group, the lower the expected RTH rate. While the essence of this is that intake volume matters, there is nothing set in stone about these particular thresholds. They arose from the available data as a good fit.</li>
				<li>The percentage of all intakes that are stray – this reflects the centrality of stray intakes and in turn the potential importance of lost/loose pet reunification efforts – higher percentages predict higher RTH rates.</li>
				<li><a href="https://www.atsdr.cdc.gov/placeandhealth/svi/index.html" target="_blank">Social Vulnerability Index</a> (SVI) for the county in which the organization is located (SVI is calculated by county, not by city, so insert the county where your city is located) – this is a rough-yet-effective way of capturing multiple dimensions of the socioeconomic situation of people served by the shelter. A higher SVI score, which means higher level of vulnerability, means a lower expected RTH rate. Other, more specific indicators like household income and poverty rates were also attempted and behaved similarly.</li>
			  </ul>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>What data was used and which organizations are included in it?</summary>
			<ul> 
				<li>The data used to model RTH rates is the full SAC database from years 2019-2022 inclusive, provided generously by SAC [NOTE: CITE/ASK PERMISSION BEFORE PUBLISHING]. </li>
				<li>Only organizations with complete contributions in the SAC dataset were included on a per-year basis (e.g., an organization that had a full year of data in 2022 but 10 months in 2021 will have the former included in the data, but not the latter). A zero-intake month also counted as a missing month.</li>
				<li>As mentioned above, organizations classified by SAC as rescues were excluded, as were organizations with less than 100 stray intakes, a threshold used to obtain a reliable RTH rate while accommodating for organizations of different sizes.</li>
				<li>At first, separate models were built for cats and dogs, as their RTH rates normally vary significantly. As analysis unfolded, we found that due to the low RTH rates for cats in most shelters (~2%) it was not possible to produce effective statistical modeling needed to provide benchmarks. Therefore, the tool is designed only for dog RTH rates. Some data about cat RTH data is described below.</li>
				<li>After this preprocessing, data from 1009 organizations was used to build the model and share its results through this tool. These include 442 government shelters, 380 nonprofits with contracts and 187 nonprofits without contracts. Regionally, 468 of the organizations included in our model are located in the South, 260 in the West, 213 Midwest, and 68 Northeast.</li>
			</ul>
		</details>
		<details>
			<summary>What about cats and cat RTH?</summary>
			<p>Cats have significantly lower RTH rates than dogs, so low that it made elaborate benchmarking unhelpful. The average RTH rate for cats across 1095 with complete cat data (filtered like dog data above) was 2%. One adjustment we made was including only cats reported in the Adult age category (as opposed to Youth or Age Unknown, the other two SAC categories), as young stray cats are less likely to be owned. This brings the average to 5% – still pretty low. Nevertheless, there are organizations out there achieving really impressive numbers – 212 organizations recorded over 10% RTH rate for cats, and 18 have exceeded 30%! These organizations with higher cat RTH rates exist across all regions, organization types, and levels of social and economical vulnerability. One organization that achieved a 35% cat RTH rate had over 3,000 stray cat intakes that year, and another returned home 16% of 9000+ stray cats!</p>
